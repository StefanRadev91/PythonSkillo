<!-- Problem 1:
Implement an online movie library like Netflix. It should have users, admins that can add/remove content, subscriptions with trial period, movies.
Every user should be able to add a movie in list of favourites. They should also be able to get a list of recommended movies (at least 3) (( Could be the last 3 added)).
They should be able to mark movies as watched and also rate the movie with a rating ranging 1 to 5. Users should be able to get a list of all watched movies.
Organize your code in modules and follow the good OOP principles.
Start with designing your classes and entities in the project.
**Tasks:**
1. Create the classes mentioned above, ensuring appropriate encapsulation and data validation where necessary.
2. Demonstrate the system's functionality by simulating interactions such as watching a movie, asking for recommendations, marking a movie as watched, rating a movie, listing all
watched movies and so on.
3. Implement tests cases accordingly -->
